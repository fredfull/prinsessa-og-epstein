an anonymous FBI agent at the American embassy in Stockholm. According to the Norwegian newspaper

information about Epstein". 
According to flight logs travelled with Jeffalpaein's private jet several times, and we're

information are you hoping to discover? Have you already contacted Are there any other Norwegian 
citizens or residents you wish to contact? Has there been any contact between the FBI or other American

Objet : Marathonienne bM 
Cher Stéphane, 
J'ai essayé de vous joindre hier. 
Je vous confirme le prix de 135 000 € pour une Marathonienne de 6,20 mètre, je vous indique qu'il faudra un acompte à la 
commande pour déclencher la fabrication 
Et compte tenu de la taille de l'objet, il faudra s'organiser pour que l'enlèvement se fasse rapidement une fois la sculpture 
terminée. 
Le délai de fabrication sera d'environ 8 à 10 semaines. 
J'attends votre retour, 
Quand à la Marathonienne de 210 cm de hauteur, je la récupère courant de la semaine prochaine. 
Voulez-vous que je vous la mette en réserve pour votre client? 
Je devrais être à Paris lundi dans l'après midi mais reste joignable sur mon portable quand vous voulez. 
Bien à vous 
Jean-Marc Lelouch

**Subject**: 

While they are in Norway, Bill and Melinda might enjoy meeting Terje and his wife, ( also a diplomat, she was 
nominated to be Ambassador to the US ) , and/or Thjorbom Jagland and his wife, both have houses on the 
fjords, I can arrange it if Bill wants. I assume they will meet Mette and Halken anyway. 
I will be able to speak with Larry late in the day tomorrow. This week I am swamped . I see now, that even late 
friday won't work. for Bill. I can confirm the 8th or 9th ( dinner ? ) I might be able to travel to Norway , if he 
would enjoy that , but I obviously need to better understand the reason for the deadline. Is there some sort of 
public filing requirement for the foundation? Would a signed but undated letter of resignation satisfy Meilinda's 
requirements. ?

FYI-I emailed Princess Mette asking if she could meet you for shopping at Prada and suggested 5:30 or 6pm... 
(Prada on Madison and 70th is open until 7pm) Eva has a meeting at 2pm but is relatively free the rest of the 
day...her assistant has penciled in shopping at Prada around 5:30 or so... 
The Princess is not real fast on getting back to me and yesterday she emailed me that she was dealing with you 
directly...

**Subject**: Re: Great to see u

Jeffrey 
It has taken me some time to respond 
Because I was in some way so overwhelmed by emotion from your email 
I know it is silly to smoke 
It pulls me not only physically towards darkness 
Isn't it so telling that that I started smoking again exactly when I met him 
I appreciate the tenderness in your email 
So I followed up. The smoking course is booked for the week I get back 
I havent gotten the trainer in place yet but will do research in Miami so I will be ready to start when I get back 
I don't know if I told you but the doctor warned me about the smoking when he examined my lungs 
At first they thought it was a blot clot.. Only dark shadows from Small things I don't know the names of 
screaming for fresh air 
Jeffrey he made me feel like the most beautiful woman on earth 
I know I will have to find that somewhere else 
And I know the only answer is within 
Thank you for seeing me 
Mm

They are likely to decline - and honestly after my interview with the woman who would 
be my boss I am not sure it would be wise to take the job. During the interview she told 
me she really wanted an internal candidate and that bringing in an outsider meant a 
huge waste of time for her..."uhhh " 
Anyway I have a really cool plan/idea. I think you will support it and reeally like it. Still

involves the WB. Got another note from Bill who really wants me to be at the WB. Too 
much to type...want to talk soon? 
Also - a really really neat idea from Steve and the LA boys. VERY CLEVER, it surprised 
me. The analogous Hollywood version of Intellectual Ventures (Nathan's gig). 
How is Mette feeling? Does she really have dengue? 
Want to talk soon? Tomorrow night late we get to BKK. There till Thursday.

The article states that the research has not found evidence that organic food contain higher rates of vitamins and 
nutrients other than potassium 
It however argues there is higher risk for finding higher levels of pesticides in non org food although it is 
believed that these levels are not high enough to pose significant health risks 
If I remember correctly you stated that organic food was in fact more unhealthy based on this article which I can 
see no proof of 
Hence the dollar bill is mine

**Subject**: Re:

Ive read and i will not se=d you dollar bill 
The article states that the rese=rch has not found evidence that organic food contain higher rates of vitami=s and 
nutrients other than potassium 
It howe=er argues there is higher risk for finding higher levels of pesticides in n=n org food although it is believed that 
these levels are not high enough to=pose significant health risks 
If I remember correc=ly you stated that organic food was in fact more unhealthy based on this ar=icle which I can see no 
proof of 
Hence the d=llar bill is mine 
Muchos gracias

Kimbal, Elon and few of their closest friends will go out that night. 
I told him that I am going w Mette for that Gala and that after we wil join them 
somewhere — or even easiest that they should come to Boom Boom Room. 
I told him that you will join us as well. Also I told him that you are coming with 
Jennifer and that he might want to ditch his ex/or current to be. He said yes and is 
looking so much forward. 
So please prepare Jen —;) 
She might like Elon as well.

**Subject**: FW: Zeitplan amfar Gala 19.5.2012

Eva is my friend there who will host us. She is very close friend with Mette as well. 
Eva and I are still trying to get Mette to join at the last moment. 
She and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below. 
The plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day. 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito and we go to that. 
ON Friday Eva is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other meetings/visits 
during day. 
On Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning. 
I leave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill. 
If you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like Eva) you should go to her brunch. 
How this seems to you???

Hallo everybody! 
Attached (sorry in Germain) the Programm fort he lifeball on the 19th. 
Actually there will be a Galadinner with our prime minister and Bill Clinton and all kinds of stars in the Hofburg 
(former Imerial estate - very impressive to see from inside)) It is only 250 people,. A seated dinner and more 
upscale than the rest oft he evening. It start's at 5pm with a Champagne cocktail and from there we go directly to 
the opening oft he ball where we'll have a really cool Box first row!! 
Dresscode: actually the lifeball is really crazy and 'half naked' We always do a intermediare because otherwise 
you feel like an idiot at the Amfar Gala dinner before. People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. Christoph 
wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be in any crazy stuff 
on all the pies. Half oft he people oft he gala dinenr also waer some 'little' crazy stuff like pink velvet sakkos 
(and a mask for later) or so. girls: Crazy as you like. There are a lot of atrists that are really dressed up. I will 
wear a quiet see-through short dress with high high heels+ a chanel Tatoo and will take a face mask fort he ball 
later. 
EFTA00934398 
So I hope this helped at least a little bit. For pies got to: lifeball.org 
Friday night: We would like to invite you all for dinner and will organize a nice place with a cool bar. Aress 
follows. Pls let me know who wants to join!! 
Sunday: I'm very sure we'll be dead :- BUT we would like to invite ou to our house/garden/pool (swimmwear) 
for brunch starting at 11 15 min with Taxi. If you fly late 
we can walk from our house to one oft he famous Austrian heurigen ...and get some more alcholic to drink :-) :-) 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito. Very hard to get tickets but for 2 of you I 
could still organize (hopefully9 if some of you already arrive on Thursday. 
Big kiss to everbody...I promise you...not often you will have seen something that crazy :-)

rest think you are working against your inetersts.. here bill has someone who works 20 hrs a 
day„ is willing to take on more, and doens't require more pay. you are traingin him to take you 
for granted and expecting him to appreciate you after the fact. . wishful thinking. I think your 
proposal should be as a fair split, he should get the 20% of the net. and allocate 30-40 million 
from larsen. . otherwise you can point out that even if you were to get a 100% return on the 10 
million, over 4 years.. an unlikely result, you would end up with less than 1.5 ,million after tax 
after 4 years,,, not fair

**Subject**: RE:

You should get a villa and do it next year 
Experience like no other, plenty of good and bad but quite collection of people 
My highlights (in no particular order) 
Hosting the global shapers from around the world (under 30) 
interactions with David Rubenstein 
Dinner with bill 
Chilling with mette and haakon 
Watching Boris be Boris 
I learned that I can bring a "spouse" with all access no questions asked. So it I get invited next year 
please be my "spouse". Not sure I will get invited back but maybe. 
Basically I learned that none of these "elite" know much more individually than I do, but their networks 
are force multipliers 
I enjoyed the philosophical discussions on capitalism 
My panel went very well (urban development in 21st century) but other private sector panelists seemed 
underinformed about Africa. It was head of Africa development bank, a big real estate guy, Cisco guy, 
transport guy and me. Questions from audience felt very superficial. 
Met some Russian oligarchs, one who told me "you are too beautiful to fly commercial" when I said I 
was leaving tomorrow 
Christine lagarde is super insecure, which was unexpected 
Arianna huffintlgton is mean to her staff 
Nuriel roubini had a huge bunch of "girlfriend" types which was weird be he's gross 
Mick jagger was tons of fun (he's 72) and surprisingly smart 
Only about 10% of attendees are "real" females the rest of the ladies are staff 
Oh met some woman from jp Morgan I think her name was Mary. She called you UNCLE F which made 
me think she was a friend but Boris later told me she was not a friend. 
I also wrote an ft story about dressing challenges 
EFTA_R1_00481194 
EFTA01989089 
Overall a terrific learning experience. Boris is my hero. He was probably the most sought after man at 
the entire event and handled it with style. 
Bill was the smartest guy on all the panels but I am not sure he was well received by the leaders. 
Certainly an ego boost for bill.

You are greatly missed here. 
Was calling you with Mette the other day. 
It is fun — BUT it is super intense — every day from 7am to 2am non-stop. 
Tonight I organized a very small dinner with Bill, david Rubenstein, Mette, Hakoon, Consuela, few other interesting YGL 
and Melanie. 
After that some hottest after party in Davos — going as Mette's date. 
On Saturday gong to London — and then all starts again. 
How are you?
