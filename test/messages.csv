Subject: Question about Jeffrey Epstein and 
To whom it may concern, 
I'm contacting you on behalf of VG, Norway's biggest newspaper, to enquire about a quote which is attributed to 
an anonymous FBI agent at the American embassy in Stockholm. According to the Norwegian newspaper 
Dagbladet/Se og Her, the FBI agent says: ""FBI wants to speak with . We're still trying to trace 
information about Epstein"". 
According to flight logs travelled with Jeffalpaein's private jet several times, and we're 
wondering if it is correct that the FBI wants to speak with in connection to Epstein? If so: Why? What 
information are you hoping to discover? Have you already contacted Are there any other Norwegian 
citizens or residents you wish to contact? Has there been any contact between the FBI or other American 
agencies and the Norwe ian overnment, Norwegian Police Security Service or other agencies concerning 
Jeffrey Epstein, or Crown Princess Mette-Marit? 
If you could please get back to me at your earliest convenience, I would greatly appreciate it. 
Best regards 
Runa Fjellanger
