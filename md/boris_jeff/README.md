**Subject**: RE: amFAR Inspiration gala

Palo Alto is like a village.

Seattle looks and feels like metropolis compared to it.

I might need to live in San Francisco and commute.

I am meeting few friends (that live between SF and Palo Alto) before my red eye flight to NYC and will

get their input.

**Subject**: amFAR Inspiration gala

I just found out that this is INSPIRATION gala and not a regular gala.

It means that it will be MAN fashion show (40 guys — many of them half dressed) - you can scc

pictures below from a last year Inspiration Gala.

piration-Fgala-Ffashion+show&tbm=isch

They will have 6 girls as well — but it is 40 vs 6.

Please let me know if you are still interested as now I am worried that it might be way TOO

GAY!

Once again — you were right!

I was always going to amfar Gala which are less gay but Inspiration are much more!

If you would rather skip it, I will organize some other time to meet Mette — she is around Monday

and Tuesday.

Please let me know asap

While they are in Norway, Bill and Melinda might enjoy meeting Terje and his wife, ( also a diplomat, she was

nominated to be Ambassador to the US ) , and/or Thjorbom Jagland and his wife, both have houses on the

fjords, I can arrange it if Bill wants. I assume they will meet Mette and Halken anyway.

I will be able to speak with Larry late in the day tomorrow. This week I am swamped . I see now, that even late

friday won't work. for Bill. I can confirm the 8th or 9th ( dinner ? ) I might be able to travel to Norway , if he

would enjoy that , but I obviously need to better understand the reason for the deadline. Is there some sort of

public filing requirement for the foundation? Would a signed but undated letter of resignation satisfy Meilinda's

requirements. ?

Got the best specialist in the area in 30minm expedited admission, dx and injection of lucentis.

There is nothing to be done right now but just wait and see.

All happened in 4h. It started around 3pm today.

Going to sleep right now — took two ambiens.

I am planning to do everything what I originally planned. Tmr board mtg, a second mtg wth

Brook, and flight to PBI.

Told Mette same,

There is a small chance that I wake up tmr early and feel that I can't handle it well — in which case

I will go back to Seattle. I hope this will not happened/

Will call you tmr.

Re the other issue — I could leave SF on Thursday after my board meeting and go to FLL or Miami — because of time

difference and flights I would be arriving late — around midnight. We could all have breakfast next morning — I think Mette

They are likely to decline - and honestly after my interview with the woman who would

be my boss I am not sure it would be wise to take the job. During the interview she told

me she really wanted an internal candidate and that bringing in an outsider meant a

huge waste of time for her..."uhhh "

Anyway I have a really cool plan/idea. I think you will support it and reeally like it. Still

involves the WB. Got another note from Bill who really wants me to be at the WB. Too

much to type...want to talk soon?

Also - a really really neat idea from Steve and the LA boys. VERY CLEVER, it surprised

me. The analogous Hollywood version of Intellectual Ventures (Nathan's gig).

How is Mette feeling? Does she really have dengue?

Want to talk soon? Tomorrow night late we get to BKK. There till Thursday.

Tomorrow Elon is whole day at that economic development meeting that I am skipping and he

goes from there to Kimbal's bday.

I will try to organize something for you guys on Sunday — although I can't attend it as I am going

OK?

I told him that you will join us as well. Also I told him that you are coming with

Eva is my friend there who will host us. She is very close friend with Mette as well.

Eva and I are still trying to get Mette to join at the last moment.

She and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below.

The plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day.

On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito and we go to that.

ON Friday Eva is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other meetings/visits

during day.

On Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning.

I leave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill.

If you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like Eva) you should go to her brunch.

How this seems to you???

Hallo everybody!

Attached (sorry in Germain) the Programm fort he lifeball on the 19th.

Actually there will be a Galadinner with our prime minister and Bill Clinton and all kinds of stars in the Hofburg

(former Imerial estate - very impressive to see from inside)) It is only 250 people,. A seated dinner and more

upscale than the rest oft he evening. It start's at 5pm with a Champagne cocktail and from there we go directly to

the opening oft he ball where we'll have a really cool Box first row!!

Dresscode: actually the lifeball is really crazy and 'half naked' We always do a intermediare because otherwise

you feel like an idiot at the Amfar Gala dinner before. People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. Christoph

wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be in any crazy stuff

on all the pies. Half oft he people oft he gala dinenr also waer some 'little' crazy stuff like pink velvet sakkos

(and a mask for later) or so. girls: Crazy as you like. There are a lot of atrists that are really dressed up. I will

wear a quiet see-through short dress with high high heels+ a chanel Tatoo and will take a face mask fort he ball

later.

EFTA00934398

So I hope this helped at least a little bit. For pies got to: lifeball.org

Friday night: We would like to invite you all for dinner and will organize a nice place with a cool bar. Aress

follows. Pls let me know who wants to join!!

Sunday: I'm very sure we'll be dead :- BUT we would like to invite ou to our house/garden/pool (swimmwear)

for brunch starting at 11 15 min with Taxi. If you fly late

we can walk from our house to one oft he famous Austrian heurigen ...and get some more alcholic to drink :-) :-)

On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito. Very hard to get tickets but for 2 of you I

could still organize (hopefully9 if some of you already arrive on Thursday.

Big kiss to everbody...I promise you...not often you will have seen something that crazy :-)

Agree 100%

Will tell you more.

Just talked to Mette — she unfortunately can't meet you as she gets in Sunday late night. She has already

full Monday and Met gala.

On Tuesday she leaves for LA. Also she has some official work in NYC.

I am meeting her in LA on Wednesday and we are going together to London.

I am trying to convince her to join us in Vienna and that she and fly together to SF0 on Sunday from

Vienna.

She is sending you her best regards

rest think you are working against your inetersts.. here bill has someone who works 20 hrs a

day„ is willing to take on more, and doens't require more pay. you are traingin him to take you

for granted and expecting him to appreciate you after the fact. . wishful thinking. I think your

proposal should be as a fair split, he should get the 20% of the net. and allocate 30-40 million

from larsen. . otherwise you can point out that even if you were to get a 100% return on the 10

million, over 4 years.. an unlikely result, you would end up with less than 1.5 ,million after tax

after 4 years,,, not fair

It has been beyond buys. Barely slept during last few days.

I will not be in NYC as I did not get Met Gala ticket (it was too complicated).

Mette will be by herself (with her best friend an Italian Vogue editor). I think she will be there Monday and Tuesday.

I am meeting her in London on Thursday or Friday (more likely).

Will call you in few hours.

Have a number updates for you

Which number to call?

**Subject**: confirmed

Some parts of story re Mette (except substance which still blows my mind).

I would hate that life — it is much worse than what we thought.
