LEADING THE NEWS 
FBI Arrests Ohio House Speaker In Corruption Probe. 
The New York Times (7/21, Rio, 18.61M) reports, ""Federal agents on Tuesday arrested one of 
the most powerful officials in Ohio state government, the Republican House speaker, along with 
a former state Republican Party chairman and three other people in what law enforcement 
officials described as a $60 million scheme to bail out a foundering energy company."" According 
to the Times, ""In a criminal complaint, the F.B.I. described a wide-ranging conspiracy in which 
the energy company helped finance the election of the House speaker, Larry Householder, in 
2018. It then allegedly bankrolled an effort led by Mr. Householder to pass a $1.3 billion bill 
subsidizing two troubled nuclear power plants and a campaign to defeat a 2019 referendum to 
repeal that bill. Along the way, the company also put $500,000 into Mr. Householder's personal 
accounts, including more than $100,000 to pay for costs related to a home he owned in Florida, 
according to the complaint."" 
Politico (7/21, Wolff, 4.29M) reports, ""Householder used some of the money to help elect 
21 candidates for the Ohio House in the 2018 elections, David DeVillers, U.S. attorney for the 
Southern District of Ohio, said at a press conference. Those candidates subsequently backed 
Householder's successful bid to become Speaker of the House last year. All but one of those 
lawmakers voted for House Bill 6, which provided the $1.3 billion to prevent the shutdown of 
FirstEnergy Solutions' two nuclear power plants and a coal plant. But even with that support, 
Householder and the others indicted had to spend millions on advertising to ensure passage of 
the bill."" 
CNN International (7/21, Cole, Ure, LeBlanc) reports, ""A criminal complaint filed on 
Thursday and unsealed on Tuesday specifically alleges that Householder and four others 
orchestrated an operation to accept over $60 million dollars from 'Company A' in return for a 
public bailout for the company worth more than $1 billion."" CNN adds, ""The charges against 
Householder were laid out in an extensive complaint that detailed a broad criminal operation 
involving wire fraud, receipt of millions of dollars in bribes and money laundering. Householder 
- along with four associates- took in millions of dollars from FirstEnergy Corp. in exchange for 
help in passing House Bill 6, a billion-dollar bailout that saved two nuclear power plants 
operated by the company."" 
Reuters (7/21, O'Brien, Gardner) reports, ""While DeVillers did not identify the company 
involved, Akron-based FirstEnergy operates the state's two nuclear plants. The company, he 
said, gave $60 million to Generation Now, a political nonprofit operated by the five men, funds 
used for lobbying that secured passage of a controversial $1.5 billion bill that bailed out the 
plants, he said. 'These allegations were bribery pure and simple; DeVillers said. FirstEnergy 
said in a release it had received subpoenas in connection with the investigation, was reviewing 
details and intends to fully cooperate with the probe."" 
Fox News (7/21, O'Reilly, 27.59M) reports, ""Along with Householder, former Ohio GOP 
chairman Matt Borges, lobbyist Neil Clark, lobbyist and Ohio Civil Rights Commission member 
Juan Cespedes and political consultant Jeff Longstreth were also arrested in connection to the 
investigation."" 
WCBE-FM Columbus, OH (7/21, Holm, 1K) reports, ""Just hours after Ohio House Speaker 
Larry Householder was arrested by federal officials in a $60 million dollar bribery case, Ohio 
Governor Mike DeWine is calling on his fellow Republican to resign. 'I am deeply concerned 
about the allegations of wrongdoing in the criminal complaint issued today by the U.S. 
Attorney's °Office. Every American has the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. 
EFTA01658206 
Because of the nature of these charges, it will be impossible for Speaker Householder to 
effectively lead the Ohio House of Representatives; therefore, I am calling on Speaker 
Householder to resign immediately."" 
Among other news outlets reporting on the charges are the Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/21, 
895K), the Cincinnati Enquirer (7/21, 223K), the Columbus (OH) Dispatch (7/21, Rouan, 367K), 
the Springfield (OH) News Sun (7/21, Spicker, 76K), The Hill (7/21, Neidig, 2.98M), NBC News 
(7/21, 6.14M), the Akron (OH) Beacon Journal (7/21, Livingston, Garrett, 198K), USA Today 
(7/21, Balmert, Coolidge, Horn, Balmert, 10.31M), the Daily Beast (7/21, Melendez, 1.39M), 
ABC News (7/21, 2.97M), the Cincinnati Enquirer (7/21, Balmert, 223K), the Wall Street 
Journal (7/21, Wernau, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), and Bloomberg (7/21, 4.73M). 
PROTESTS 
ABC News/Washington Post Poll: Most Oppose Defunding Police, Removing Statues. 
The Washington Post (7/21, Guskin, Clement, Balz, 14.2M) reports an ABC News/Washington 
Post poll of 1,006 US adults released Tuesday conducted July 12-15 shows ""a majority of 
Americans support the Black Lives Matter movement and a record 69 percent say black people 
and other minorities are not treated as equal to white people in the criminal justice system."" 
The poll also shows ""the public generally opposes calls to shift some police funding to social 
services or remove statues of Confederate generals or presidents who enslaved people."" 
The Washington Times (7/21, Sherfinski, 492K) reports poll data shows 55% opposed 
""reducing funding for police departments and spending that money on social services instead,"" 
while 40% support such efforts; and 52% opposed ""removing statues honoring Confederate 
generals from public places"" while 43% support that. The poll also shows 50% oppose 
""renaming military bases named after Confederate generals"" while 42% favor the change. In 
other results, ""69% of Americans said Black people and other minorities are denied equal 
treatment in the criminal justice system and that 63% of Americans support the Black Lives 
Matter movement."" The Washington Examiner (7/21, Doyle, 448K) says the poll shows ""most 
people in the United States"" are ""siding with President Trump on an issue over which he has 
been repeatedly slapped down."" 
White House Calls Prosecution Of McCloskeys ""Extreme Abuse Of Power."" 
The Washington Times (7/21, Boyer, 492K) reports the White House said Tuesday that 
President Trump believes the prosecution of a St. Louis couple ""for defending their home with 
firearms against a group of protesters"" is an ""extreme abuse of power."" White House Press 
Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, ""They were completely within their rights,"" adding that the 
President observed that there have been ""many cases brought to [the local prosecutor's] 
attention of violent rioters that she's failed to charge, but instead she's charging the individuals 
who were defending themselves from violent protesters."" 
A Wall Street Journal (7/21, Board, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorial rejects the 
charges against the McCloskeys as politically motivated. 
Trump: ""The Game Is Over For Me"" If Players Kneel During National Anthem. 
President Trump on Tuesday tweeted, ""Looking forward to live sports, but any time I witness a 
player kneeling during the National Anthem, a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our 
Flag, the game is over for me!"" 
Minneapolis Police See Surge Of Departures In Wake Of Floyd Protests. 
The New York Times (7/21, Eligon, 18.61M) reports that nearly two months after ""four of its 
officers were charged with killing George Floyd, the Minneapolis Police Department is reeling, 
with police officers leaving the job in large numbers, crime surging and politicians planning a 
EFTA01658207 
top-to-bottom overhaul of the force."" According to veteran officers, ""morale within the 
department is lower than they have ever experienced,"" and ""some officers are scaling back their 
policing efforts, concerned that any contentious interactions on the street could land them in 
trouble."" Others, meanwhile, ""are calling it quits altogether."" 
Minnesota Lawmakers Pass Police Accountability Measures. The Minneapolis Star 
Tribune (7/20, Bierschbach, 1.04M) reports the Minnesota state legislature passed ""a sweeping 
package of police accountability measures early Tuesday morning following two months of 
touch-and-go negotiations after the killing of George Floyd."" Calling the bill ""one of the most 
substantial changes to the state's criminal justice system in years,"" the Star Tribune notes it 
""includes a statewide ban on chokeholds and neck restraints...and a prohibition on warrior-style 
training for officers."" It also ""enhances data collection around deadly force encounters, requires 
officers to intervene and creates a new state unit to investigate such cases."" The Wall Street 
Journal (7/21, Barrett, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Gov. Tim Walz (DFL) has not 
said whether he will sign the bill. 
Minneapolis Residents Propose Citywide Vote To End Police Department. The 
Minneapolis Star Tribune (7/20, Navratil, 1.04M) reports that a ""public hearing Tuesday night 
was dominated by demands to allow Minneapolis residents to vote on a proposal that could end 
the city's Police Department."" Dozens of residents ""urged the city's Charter Commission to allow 
them to vote in November on a divisive proposal that would dramatically reshape public safety 
in the city."" 
Charred Body Found Inside Minneapolis Pawn Shop Burned During Protests. The 
Washington Times (7/21, Ernst, 492K) reports that the ""charred remains of a Minneapolis man 
have been found inside a pawn shop razed during the May riots."" A ""recent tip"" to the 
Minneapolis Police Department, ATF and the state fire marshal's division ""led authorities to the 
grim discovery Monday inside Max It Pawn, which was destroyed in an arson fire May 28."" 
Portland Protests Continue As Trump Considers Sending Federal Officers To Chicago. 
The AP (7/21, Long, Fox, Colvin), in a piece titled ""Trump's Show Of Federal Force Sparking 
Alarm In Cities,"" reports that President Trump's ""plan to deploy federal agents to Chicago and 
perhaps other Democratic-run cities where violence is spiking represents Trump's latest effort to 
use an agency that was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to thwart terrorists to instead 
supplement local law enforcement in ways that bolster his reelection chances."" Trump has 
""already deployed Homeland Security agents to Portland,"" and under Trump's ""latest plan, yet 
to be publicly announced, about 150 Homeland Security Investigations agents would go to 
Chicago."" 
According to the Wall Street Journal (7/21, Gurman, Ailworth, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M), sources familiar with the plans said more than 100 federal agents will be deployed to 
Chicago to focus on illegal gun sales, aiding federal gun prosecutions and arrests. 
USA Today (7/21, Hauck, 10.31M) reports Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday the 
Administration ""would not be deploying unnamed federal officers to the city, as seen in Portland 
in recent days."" Said the Mayor, ""What I understand at this point, and I caveat that, is that the 
Trump administration is not going to foolishly deploy unnamed agents to the streets of Chicago. 
We have information that allows us to say, at least at this point, that we don't see a Portland- 
style deployment coming to Chicago."" Instead, she said the Administration is instead sending 
agents from the FBI, DEA and ATF. The Chicago Tribune (7/21, Pratt, Gorner, Munks, 2.65M), 
among other news outlets, also reports Lightfoot's comments. 
All three networks, meanwhile, reported Tuesday night on the ongoing protests in Portland 
and the deployment of federal agents to the city. ABC World News TonightVI (7/21, story 4, 
1:40, Muir, 7.14M) reported there were ""new clashes"" with ""protesters facing off against federal 
agents there, despite the objections of the mayor and the governor."" ABC (Whitworth) added, 
""In a 'NightlineVi ' interview, the acting DHS Deputy Secretary saying tonight those agents in 
Portland are within their rights to protect the courthouse."" Acting DHS Deputy Secretary 
EFTA01658208 
Cuccinelli: ""This is a long established federal practice. It's well within the authority of the 
federal government."" 
Cuccinelli said on Mornings on the Mall (7/21) (interview begins at 2:08:04) that Portland 
has ""had 54 straight says of violence which is just extraordinary, longer than any place in the 
country. ... And part of that violence has been directed at federal facilities and federal officers. 
The law gives DHS the responsibility of protecting those facilities like the Hatfield Courthouse. 
... This is not a new mission for us and the idea that we would suspend that mission...is really 
quite silly."" Cuccinelli said on Fox News' Your World, ""We certainly are well within the boundaries 
of the law and the Constitution."" Cuccinelli was also interviewed on the Rush Limbaugh ShowVI 
(7/21, 165K), the Lars Larson ShowVi (7/21), 
The Washington Post (7/21, Miroff, Zapotosky, 14.2M) reports ""legal analysts say that 
while the department has broad authority to enforce federal laws, officers' actions — especially 
in Portland, Ore. — seemed to be pushing the boundaries and pulling DHS into a domestic 
policing role."" DHS officials, however, ""defended their tactics in Portland again Tuesday, saying 
the department has an obligation to protect government buildings in the city that have been 
targeted"" by protesters. 
The New York Times (7/21, Al, Baker, 18.61M) reports Acting DHS Secretary Wolf ""said at 
a news conference on Tuesday that he had tried to collaborate with Mayor Wheeler and Gov. 
Kate Brown, asking them this month whether they were overwhelmed and wanted resources, 
including personnel."" Wolf ""said that when he asked what they needed to 'bring the violence to 
a close and still allow the peaceful protesters to protest each and every night,' they told him to 
stay out of the city."" The Washington Times (7/21, Richardson, 492K), among other news 
outlets, also reports Wolf's comments. 
Wolf, on The Hugh Hewitt ShowVi (7/21) Tuesday, said DHS is ""taking a proactive 
approach in Portland where we are in the midst of making sure that we have federal properties, 
including the courthouse there, safe and secure overnight. What we have seen in Portland is 
that the Mayor has abdicated his responsibility there in letting these violent crowds form night 
after night, targeting that courthouse and our law enforcement officers. So, that is of concern 
to us and we will continue to protect that building."" 
On Fox News The Story (7/21), Wolf said, ""We have clear authority. We outlined that on 
several occasions. The Federal Protective Service, part of the Department of Homeland Security 
protects almost 9,000 federal facilities across the country. They do that in Portland. Portland is 
the only city that we have this radical violence night after night. We are on our 52nd night of 
violence against that courthouse against other federal facilities and other law enforcement 
officers. I would say we don't have this issue and rails because we have local officials and local 
law enforcement working with us to protect our facilities."" Wolf was also interviewed on The 
Brian Kilmeade Show (Radio) (7/21). 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/21, story 6, 2:10, Holt, 6.23M) reported, ""The Trump 
Administration says it sent federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to defend federal buildings 
against violent attacks. But the mayor there says that escalated the conflict. Now, mayors from 
six major cities are sending this letter to the Attorney General, blasting that deployment."" In 
the letter, the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/21, story 6, 1:50, O'Donnell, 4.49M) reported, ""mayors 
from six cities...demand[ed] the President take immediate action to withdraw"" federal agents. 
Elsewhere on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Esper ""raised concerns about the officers' military- 
style fatigues."" Esper, Politico (7/21, Seligman, 4.29M) reports, ""has raised concerns within the 
administration about federal agents patrolling the streets of U.S. cities in camouflage uniforms 
similar to those worn by troops in war zones, his spokesperson said Tuesday."" 
In a report headlined ""Facing Federal Agents, Portland Protests Find New Momentum,"" the 
AP (7/21, Flaccus) reports that ""crowds in Portland had recently numbered fewer than 100 
people but swelled to more than 1,000 over the weekend — and they're once again attracting a 
broader base in a city that's increasingly outraged"" of the deployment of federal agents. 
EFTA01658209 
The Washington Post (7/21, Shepherd, 14.2M) reports that ""experts and local activists say 
Trump's claims are the latest in a sustained efforts by conservative commentators and 
politicians to marry the myth of Antifa terrorists to a city where discontent has grown for years 
over increasingly harsh police responses at protests."" The Washington Times (7/21, Sherfinski, 
492K) reports that Trump's deployment of federal agents to Portland, ""and possibly elsewhere is 
seeing pushback not only from Democrats but also from conservatives and libertarians who say 
the federal government can't indiscriminately throw its weight around and trample on 
constitutional rights."" 
Elizabeth Vaughn, however, writes for The Federalist (7/21, 126K) that ""President Trump 
has every right to send in 'the feds' when federal laws are being broken, especially when city 
and state officials fail to act."" 
Former FBI director James Comey writes in the Washington Post (7/21, 14.2M) that while 
""it is not clear that federal officers in Portland are acting unlawfully,"" what ""is clear is that they 
are acting stupidly, a mistake they may be about to repeat in other places, with lasting 
consequences for federal law enforcement."" For DHS, Comey says, ""it will now be a long road 
back to trust and partnerships."" Comey argues that, ""yet again, the craving of our president for 
reelection seems to override everything."" 
Oregon State Lawmakers, Groups File Suit Against Federal Law Enforcement 
Agencies. The Oregonian (7/21, Bernstein, 1M) reports that ""two Oregon state lawmakers, 
the Western States Center Inc., a Portland church and a Portland attorney have joined to sue 
four federal law enforcement agencies that are providing tactical officers to defend the 
downtown federal courthouse."" State Reps. Janelle S. Bynum (D-Clackamas) and Karin A. Power 
(D-Milwaukee), ""along with Portland lawyer and legal observer Sara D. Eddie, the First Unitarian 
Church of Portland and Western States Center, which tracks extremist groups and provides 
support to social movements, filed suit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland against the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customers and Border Protection, Federal 
Protective Service and U.S. Marshals Service."" The suit contends the federal agents ""have 
encroached on state powers and violated the First Unitarian Church of Portland's right to protest 
and practice social activism"" that are ""protected under the First Amendment's free exercise of 
religion clause, according to attorney Clifford S. Davidson."" 
De Blasio Threatens Legal Action If Trump Sends Federal Officers. The AP (7/21) 
reports New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that President Trump's ""threat to send 
federal law enforcers to patrol the city is likely not serious but if he did follow through, New 
York City would take legal action."" Said de Blasio, ""I have to start by saying this president 
blusters and bluffs and says he's going to do things and they never materialize on a regular 
basis."" He added that if Trump did send federal officers to New York City, ""it would only create 
more problems. It would backfire, it wouldn't make us safer, and we would immediately take 
action in court to stop it."" 
Trump Campaign Ads Warn Of Anarchy In Democratic-Led Cities. The New York 
Times (7/21, Al, Haberman, Corasaniti, Karni, 18.61M) reports that as President Trump 
deploys federal agents to Portland and ""threatens to dispatch more to other cities, his re- 
election campaign is spending millions of dollars on several ominous television ads that promote 
fear and dovetail with his political message of 'law and order.'"" The Trump campaign is ""driving 
home that message with a new ad that tries to tie its dark portrayal of Democratic-led cities"" to 
Joe Biden ""with exaggerated images intended to persuade viewers that lawless anarchy would 
prevail if Mr. Biden won the presidency."" To date, the campaign has spent ""almost $20 million 
over the last 20 days"" on the ads. 
Fourteen Shot Outside Chicago Funeral Home. The Chicago Sun-Times (7/21, Main, 
Behm, Charles, Camarillo, 875K) reports that 14 people were shot Tuesday night outside a 
funeral home in Chicago's South Side — ""the largest number of victims in a single Chicago 
shooting in recent memory."" The shooting happened ""about 6:30 p.m. as people left a funeral."" 
EFTA01658210 
The Chicago Tribune (7/22, Nickeas, Fry, Greene, Gorner, 2.65M) reports police said the 
""funeral attendees exchanged gunfire with those"" inside a passing vehicle.

The Washington Examiner (7/21, Mastrangelo, 448K) reports that a ""dozen police officers were 
injured in Seattle when they were attacked by violent demonstrators while monitoring a 
separate peaceful demonstration against police brutality and US Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement."" Police, ""clad in riot gear, used pepper spray to clear the area and 'stop the 
assault on officers,' the department said in a news release."" Two protesters were arrested. 
Mother Of Seattle Protester Killed By Police Sues City. Breitbart (7/21, Caplan, 
673K) reports Donnitta Sinclair, ""mother of 19-year-old Lorenzo Anderson — who was shot 
dead in Seattle's now-dismantled Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) zone — has hit the 
Democrat-controlled city with a wrongful death claim, according to local reports."" The Seattle 
Times says the suit alleges ""city officials created a dangerous environment by allowing 
protesters to occupy six city blocks and that police and fire officials failed to protect or 
medically assist her son."" 
Teens Charged With Terrorism Following Oklahoma City Protests. 
The Fox News (7/21, Wallace, 27.59M) website reports that ""two teenagers are the latest to 
face terrorism charges after allegedly helping to break in the windows of an Oklahoma City bail 
bonds business in late May during the civil unrest that swept the nation in the wake of the 
death of George Floyd."" On Monday, ""several dozen protesters conducted a sit-in at the office of 
Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater,"" demanding that he drop the terrorism charges 
and resign. 
Senate Blocks Push To Limit Military Gear For Police. 
The New York Times (7/21, Edmondson, 18.61M) reports the Senate on Tuesday ""rejected a 
bipartisan bid to bar the Pentagon from transferring a wide range of military-grade weaponry to 
local police departments, effectively killing the last remaining initiative before Congress this 
year to address the excessive use of force in law enforcement."" The measure, which lawmakers 
""sought to attach to the must-pass annual defense bill, was a last-ditch attempt to begin to 
demilitarize law enforcement after a nationwide uproar to address racial discrimination and 
distrust between the police and the communities they serve."" To the Times, the ""51 to 44"" vote, 
""which failed to reach the required 60-vote threshold to pass, underscored how fraught and 
often fruitless attempts to rein in the program have become."" 
Atlantic Updates Essay On Police Shooting Written By Activist. 
The Federalist (7/21, Bedford, 126K) reports that an Atlantic essay titled ""How I Became a 
Police Abolitionist"" by social justice activist and lawyer Derecka Purnell, first published July 6, 
""tells of her childhood in a polluted neighborhood surrounded by violence and beset by fear, 
using one particularly disturbing memory of a police officer shooting their cousin...in the arm."" 
An investigation by The Federalist ""encompassing newspaper archives, police department 
records, questions to The Atlantic, the police union, and the office of the mayor, however, called 
the story — including facts about the neighborhood, the timeline of the incident, and if the 
incident described even happened at all — into question."" On Monday afternoon, The Atlantic 
""updated"" the article to read that Purnell's cousin was shot by ""a uniformed security guard."" 
Liberal Virginia Prosecutors, Democratic Legislators Show United Front On Police 
Overhaul. 
The Washington Post (7/20, Jouvenal, Schneider, 14.2M) reports that a ""group of Virginia's 
liberal prosecutors appeared alongside state Senate Democrats on Monday to provide a unified 
front in support of a slate of measures to overhaul policing and criminal justice ahead of a 
EFTA01658211 
special session of the legislature in August."" The prosecutors were joined by ""nearly a dozen 
commonwealth's attorneys representing some of Virginia's largest jurisdictions are endorsing 
the push for change."" To the Post, their news conference ""demonstrated Democrats' hopes for 
implementing substantial measures after winning both houses of the legislature last year and 
expanding the cohort of liberals in prosecutors' offices across the state."" 
Trader Joe's Pledges To Change Packaging After Accusations Of Racism. 
The Los Angeles Times (7/21, Lai, 4.64M) reports that Trader Joe's ""has come under attack for 
its branding of ethnic foods"" with ""the names Trader Ming's, Arabian Joe's, Trader Jose's, Trader 
Giotto's and Trader Joe San."" An online petition accused the store of ""racist"" labeling. In 
response, a spokeswoman for Trader Joe's ""said the company is changing the packaging and 
expects to complete the process 'very soon."" The Times also reports that ""inside the Trader 
Joe's in Temecula, shoppers crowded the aisles on Monday,"" and ""were either unconcerned or 
hadn't paid attention to the controversy caused by the product labeling."" 
Intern Jonah Gottschalk writes at the Federalist (7/21, Gottschalk, 126K) that the ""phony 
outrage at Trader Joe's proves how outlets like the New York Times use 'public pressure' to 
make companies and politicians do what they want."" Gottschalk explains that a petition at 
change.org had been up for weeks with few signers, but the New York Times put it on its front 
page on Sunday, and ""the story was then swiftly written up by numerous outlets,"" then ""Trader 
Joe's panicked,"" and ""apologized and claimed it will remove the 'light-hearted attempt at 
inclusiveness."" Gottschalk writes, ""The incident serves as an excellent case study for a new 
form of journalistic malpractice."" 
Poll: Most Voters Agree Black, Hispanic Americans Face Discrimination.

18.61M) reports that ""with more than 2,000 incidents and little action from the federal 
government, efforts to curtail pandemic-related racism have fallen to P.S.A.s and social media 
campaigns."" The new public service announcement by the nonprofit Advertising Council that 
debuted Tuesday ""makes a point that federal leaders have largely overlooked: Asian-Americans 
are facing a surge of harassment linked to fears about the coronavirus pandemic."" 
Facebook Creates Teams To Study Racial Bias On Its Platforms. 
The Wall Street Journal (7/21, Seetharaman, Horwitz, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports

Manhattan health clinic"" because of her ""harmful connections to the eugenics movement,"" the 
group said Tuesday. Sanger, a nurse who opened the first birth control clinic in the US, 
supported eugenics, ""a discredited belief in improving the human race through selective 
breeding."" The Washington Times (7/21, Blake, 492K) reports the group explained the move ""is 
both a necessary and overdue step to reckon with our legacy and acknowledge Planned 
Parenthood's contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color."" 
COUNTER-TERRORISM 
Tsarnaev Awaits Appeals Court Ruling On Execution. 
EFTA01658212 
The MetroWest M) Daily News (7/21, Miller, 71K) reports, ""Since the U.S. Supreme Court 
cleared the way last month for federal executions, three federal prisoners have been put to 
death for the crimes they were convicted of committing,"" but ""despite that, there is still no time 
frame for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to face the death penalty, 
even though he was sentenced to death in 2015 after being found guilty of 30 counts connected 
to the fatal April 2013 bombing."" According to the Daily News, ""Tsarnaev's lawyers in December 
2019, argued in front of the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, that the death penalty 
ruling should be thrown out. They argue that Tsarnaev did not receive a fair trial. They argued 
the trial should have been moved out of Boston, rather than it being held in the midst of where 
the bombing occurred. The three-judge panel has yet to issue a ruling in the appeal.""

Program.

public debate."" In an interview with NPR, Travers also ""expressed frustration at the poor state 
of relations between the intelligence community and the Trump Administration."" Russ Travers, 
who served as acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told NPR's Mary Louise 
Kelly, co-host of `All Things Considered,' in his first broadcast interview since leaving his 
government post, ""If people believe that conditions have so changed and the threat is so 
diminished that we can go back to the way things were [before the 9/11 attacks], so be it. I 
just personally don't believe that's the right answer. And I don't like the quality of the 
discussion that has gotten us to this point."" Travers ""said he's never seen such bad relations 
between intelligence professionals and a presidential administration."" 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
DO) Prepared For More Mueller Declassifications. 
The Washington Examiner (7/21, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that the DO) ""has determined more

reviews recently declassified reports from the FBI, including the memo by former FBI official

McCain was 'compromised' because he was provided a copy of the dossier."" Text messages

LEADING THE NEWS 
FBI Arrests Ohio House Speaker In Corruption Probe. 
The New York Times (7/21, Rio, 18.61M) reports, ""Federal agents on Tuesday arrested one of the 
most powerful officials in Ohio state government, the Republican House speaker, along with a 
former state Republican Party chairman and three other people in what law enforcement officials 
described as a $60 million scheme to bail out a foundering energy company."" According to the 
Times, ""In a criminal complaint, the F.B.I. described a wide-ranging conspiracy in which the 
energy company helped finance the election of the House speaker, Larry Householder, in 2018. It 
then allegedly bankrolled an effort led by Mr. Householder to pass a $1.3 billion bill subsidizing two 
troubled nuclear power plants and a campaign to defeat a 2019 referendum to repeal that bill. 
Along the way, the company also put $500,000 into Mr. Householder's personal accounts, including 
more than $100,000 to pay for costs related to a home he owned in Florida, according to the 
complaint."" 
Politico (7/21, Wolff, 4.29M) reports, ""Householder used some of the money to help elect 21 
candidates for the Ohio House in the 2018 elections, David DeVillers, U.S. attorney for the 
Southern District of Ohio, said at a press conference. Those candidates subsequently backed 
Householder's successful bid to become Speaker of the House last year. All but one of those 
lawmakers voted for House Bill 6, which provided the $1.3 billion to prevent the shutdown of 
FirstEnergy Solutions' two nuclear power plants and a coal plant. But even with that support, 
Householder and the others indicted had to spend millions on advertising to ensure passage of the 
bill."" 
CNN International (7/21, Cole, Ure, LeBlanc) reports, ""A criminal complaint filed on Thursday 
and unsealed on Tuesday specifically alleges that Householder and four others orchestrated an 
operation to accept over $60 million dollars from 'Company A' in return for a public bailout for the 
company worth more than $1 billion."" CNN adds, ""The charges against Householder were laid out 
in an extensive complaint that detailed a broad criminal operation involving wire fraud, receipt of 
millions of dollars in bribes and money laundering. Householder - along with four associates- took 
in millions of dollars from FirstEnergy Corp. in exchange for help in passing House Bill 6, a billion- 
dollar bailout that saved two nuclear power plants operated by the company."" 
Reuters (7/21, O'Brien, Gardner) reports, ""While DeVillers did not identify the company 
involved, Akron-based FirstEnergy operates the state's two nuclear plants. The company, he said, 
gave $60 million to Generation Now, a political nonprofit operated by the five men, funds used for 
EFTA00135629 
lobbying that secured passage of a controversial $1.5 billion bill that bailed out the plants, he said. 
'These allegations were bribery pure and simple,' DeVillers said. ArstEnergy said in a release it 
had received subpoenas in connection with the investigation, was reviewing details and intends to 
fully cooperate with the probe."" 
Fox News (7/21, O'Reilly, 27.59M) reports, ""Along with Householder, former Ohio GOP 
chairman Matt Borges, lobbyist Neil Clark, lobbyist and Ohio Civil Rights Commission member 
Juan Cespedes and political consultant Jeff Longstreth were also arrested in connection to the 
investigation."" 
WCBE-FM Columbus, OH (7/21, Holm, 1K) reports, ""Just hours after Ohio House Speaker 
Larry Householder was arrested by federal officials in a $60 million dollar bribery case, Ohio 
Governor Mike DeWine is calling on his fellow Republican to resign. 'I am deeply concerned about 
the allegations of wrongdoing in the criminal complaint issued today by the U.S. Attorney's °Office. 
Every American has the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Because of the nature of 
these charges, it will be impossible for Speaker Householder to effectively lead the Ohio House of 
Representatives; therefore, I am calling on Speaker Householder to resign immediately."" 
Among other news outlets reporting on the charges are the fleveland Plain Dealer (7/21, 
895K), the rinrinnati Fnquirer (7/21, 223K), the Columbus (OH) Dispatch (7/21, Rouan, 367K), the 
Springfield (OH) News Sun (7/21, Spicker, 76K), The Hill (7/21, Neidig, 2.98M), NBC News (7/21, 
6.14M), the Akron (OH) Beacon Journal (7/21, Livingston, Garrett, 198K), USA Today (7/21, 
Balmert, Coolidge, Horn, Balmert, 10.31M), the Daily Beast (7/21, Melendez, 1.39M), ABC' News 
(7/21, 2.97M), the Cincinnati Enquirer (7/21, Balmert, 223K), the Wall Street Journal (7/21, 
Wernau, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), and Filnomberg (7/21, 4.73M). 
PROTESTS 
ABC News/Washington Post Poll: Most Oppose Defunding Police, Removing Statues. 
The Washington Post (7/21, Guskin, Clement, Balz, 14.2M) reports an ABC News/Washington Post 
gall of 1,006 US adults released Tuesday conducted July 12-15 shows ""a majority of Americans 
support the Black Lives Matter movement and a record 69 percent say black people and other 
minorities are not treated as equal to white people in the criminal justice system."" The poll also 
shows ""the public generally opposes calls to shift some police funding to social services or remove 
statues of Confederate generals or presidents who enslaved people."" 
The Washington Times (7/21, Sherfinski, 492K) reports poll data shows 55% opposed 
""reducing funding for police departments and spending that money on social services instead,"" 
while 40% support such efforts; and 52% opposed ""removing statues honoring Confederate 
generals from public places"" while 43% support that. The poll also shows 50% oppose ""renaming 
military bases named after Confederate generals"" while 42% favor the change. In other results,

observed that there have been ""many cases brought to [the local prosecutor's] attention of violent 
rioters that she's failed to charge, but instead she's charging the individuals who were defending 
themselves from violent protesters.""

Portland Protests Continue As Trump Considers Sending Federal Officers To Chicago. 
The AR (7/21, Long, Fox, Colvin), in a piece titled ""Trump's Show Of Federal Force Sparking Alarm 
In Cities,"" reports that President Trump's ""plan to deploy federal agents to Chicago and perhaps 
other Democratic-run cities where violence is spiking represents Trump's latest effort to use an 
agency that was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to thwart terrorists to instead supplement local 
law enforcement in ways that bolster his reelection chances."" Trump has ""already deployed 
Homeland Security agents to Portland,"" and under Trump's ""latest plan, yet to be publicly 
announced, about 150 Homeland Security Investigations agents would go to Chicago."" 
According to the Wall Street Journal (7/21, Gurman, Ailworth, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M), sources familiar with the plans said more than 100 federal agents will be deployed to 
Chicago to focus on illegal gun sales, aiding federal gun prosecutions and arrests. 
USA Today (7/21, Hauck, 10.31M) reports Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday the 
Administration ""would not be deploying unnamed federal officers to the city, as seen in Portland in 
recent days."" Said the Mayor, ""What I understand at this point, and I caveat that, is that the 
Trump administration is not going to foolishly deploy unnamed agents to the streets of Chicago. 
We have information that allows us to say, at least at this point, that we don't see a Portland-style 
deployment coming to Chicago."" Instead, she said the Administration is instead sending agents 
from the FBI, DEA and ATF. The chiragn Tribune (7/21, Pratt, Gorner, Munks, 2.65M), among 
EFTA00135631 
other news outlets, also reports Lightfoot's comments. 
All three networks, meanwhile, reported Tuesday night on the ongoing protests in Portland 
and the deployment of federal agents to the city. ABC World News Tonight (7/21, story 4, 1:40, 
Muir, 7.14M) reported there were ""new clashes"" with ""protesters facing off against federal agents 
there, despite the objections of the mayor and the governor."" ABC (Whitworth) added, ""In a 
'Nightline ' ' interview, the acting DHS Deputy Secretary saying tonight those agents in Portland 
are within their rights to protect the courthouse."" Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli: ""This is 
a long established federal practice. It's well within the authority of the federal government."" 
Cuccinelli said on Mornings on the Mall (7/21) (interview begins at 2:08:04) that Portland has 
""had 54 straight says of violence which is just extraordinary, longer than any place in the country. 
... And part of that violence has been directed at federal facilities and federal officers. The law 
gives DHS the responsibility of protecting those facilities like the Hatfield Courthouse. ... This is not 
a new mission for us and the idea that we would suspend that mission...is really quite silly."" 
Cuccinelli said on Fox News' Your World, ""We certainly are well within the boundaries of the law 
and the Constitution."" Cuccinelli was also interviewed on the Rush Limbaugh Show (7/21, 165K), 
the Lars Larson Show' (7/21), 
The Washington Post (7/21, Miroff, Zapotosky, 14.2M) reports ""legal analysts say that while 
the department has broad authority to enforce federal laws, officers' actions — especially in 
Portland, Ore. — seemed to be pushing the boundaries and pulling DHS into a domestic policing 
role."" DHS officials, however, ""defended their tactics in Portland again Tuesday, saying the 
department has an obligation to protect government buildings in the city that have been targeted"" 
by protesters. 
The New York Times (7/21, Al, Baker, 18.61M) reports Acting DHS Secretary Wolf ""said at a 
news conference on Tuesday that he had tried to collaborate with Mayor Wheeler and Gov. Kate 
Brown, asking them this month whether they were overwhelmed and wanted resources, including 
personnel."" Wolf ""said that when he asked what they needed to 'bring the violence to a close and 
still allow the peaceful protesters to protest each and every night,' they told him to stay out of the 
city."" The Washington Times (7/21, Richardson, 492K), among other news outlets, also reports 
Wolf's comments. 
Wolf, on The Hugh Hewitt Show (7/21) Tuesday, said DHS is ""taking a proactive approach 
in Portland where we are in the midst of making sure that we have federal properties, including 
the courthouse there, safe and secure overnight. What we have seen in Portland is that the Mayor 
has abdicated his responsibility there in letting these violent crowds form night after night, 
targeting that courthouse and our law enforcement officers. So, that is of concern to us and we will 
continue to protect that building."" 
On Fox News The Story (7/21), Wolf said, ""We have clear authority. We outlined that on 
several occasions. The Federal Protective Service, part of the Department of Homeland Security 
protects almost 9,000 federal facilities across the country. They do that in Portland. Portland is the 
only city that we have this radical violence night after night. We are on our 52nd night of violence 
against that courthouse against other federal facilities and other law enforcement officers. I would 
say we don't have this issue and rails because we have local officials and local law enforcement 
working with us to protect our facilities."" Wolf was also interviewed on The Brian Kilmeade Show 
(Radio\ (7/21). 
NRC Niahtly_IJ ws' (7/21, story 6, 2:10, Holt, 6.23M) reported, ""The Trump Administration 
says it sent federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to defend federal buildings against violent attacks. 
But the mayor there says that escalated the conflict. Now, mayors from six major cities are 
sending this letter to the Attorney General, blasting that deployment."" In the letter, the CBS. 
Evening News' (7/21, story 6, 1:50, O'Donnell, 4.49M) reported, ""mayors from six 
cities...demand[ed] the President take immediate action to withdraw"" federal agents. Elsewhere 
on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Esper ""raised concerns about the officers' military-style fatigues."" 
Esper, Politico (7/21, Seligman, 4.29M) reports, ""has raised concerns within the administration 
about federal agents patrolling the streets of U.S. cities in camouflage uniforms similar to those 
worn by troops in war zones, his spokesperson said Tuesday."" 
EFTA00135632 
In a report headlined ""Facing Federal Agents, Portland Protests Find New Momentum,"" the AP 
(7/21, Flaccus) reports that ""crowds in Portland had recently numbered fewer than 100 people but 
swelled to more than 1,000 over the weekend — and they're once again attracting a broader base 
in a city that's increasingly outraged"" of the deployment of federal agents. 
The Washington Post (7/21, Shepherd, 14.2M) reports that ""experts and local activists say 
Trump's claims are the latest in a sustained efforts by conservative commentators and politicians 
to marry the myth of Antifa terrorists to a city where discontent has grown for years over 
increasingly harsh police responses at protests."" The Washington Times (7/21, Sherfinski, 492K) 
reports that Trump's deployment of federal agents to Portland, ""and possibly elsewhere is seeing 
pushback not only from Democrats but also from conservatives and libertarians who say the 
federal government can't indiscriminately throw its weight around and trample on constitutional 
rights."" 
Elizabeth Vaughn, however, writes for The Federalist (7/21, 126K) that ""President Trump has 
every right to send in 'the feds' when federal laws are being broken, especially when city and state 
officials fail to act."" 
Former FBI director James Comey writes in the Washington (7/21, 14.2M) that while ""it 
is not clear that federal officers in Portland are acting unlawfully,"" what ""is clear is that they are 
acting stupidly, a mistake they may be about to repeat in other places, with lasting consequences 
for federal law enforcement."" For DHS, Comey says, ""it will now be a long road back to trust and 
partnerships."" Comey argues that, ""yet again, the craving of our president for reelection seems to 
override everything."" 
Oregon State Lawmakers, Groups File Suit Against Federal Law Enforcement 
Agencies. The Oregonian (7/21, Bernstein, 1M) reports that ""two Oregon state lawmakers, the 
Western States Center Inc., a Portland church and a Portland attorney have joined to sue four 
federal law enforcement agencies that are providing tactical officers to defend the downtown 
federal courthouse."" State Reps. Janelle S. Bynum (D-Clackamas) and Karin A. Power (D- 
Milwaukee), ""along with Portland lawyer and legal observer Sara D. Eddie, the First Unitarian 
Church of Portland and Western States Center, which tracks extremist groups and provides 
support to social movements, filed suit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland against the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customers and Border Protection, Federal Protective 
Service and U.S. Marshals Service."" The suit contends the federal agents ""have encroached on 
state powers and violated the First Unitarian Church of Portland's right to protest and practice 
social activism"" that are ""protected under the First Amendment's free exercise of religion clause, 
according to attorney Clifford S. Davidson."" 
De Blasio Threatens Legal Action If Trump Sends Federal Officers. The AP (7/21) 
reports New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that President Trump's ""threat to send 
federal law enforcers to patrol the city is likely not serious but if he did follow through, New York 
City would take legal action."" Said de Blasio, ""I have to start by saying this president blusters and 
bluffs and says he's going to do things and they never materialize on a regular basis."" He added 
that if Trump did send federal officers to New York City, ""it would only create more problems. It 
would backfire, it wouldn't make us safer, and we would immediately take action in court to stop 
it."" 
Trump Campaign Ads Warn Of Anarchy In Democratic-Led Cities. The New York 
Times (7/21, Al, Haberman, Corasaniti, Karni, 18.61M) reports that as President Trump deploys 
federal agents to Portland and ""threatens to dispatch more to other cities, his re-election campaign 
is spending millions of dollars on several ominous television ads that promote fear and dovetail 
with his political message of 'law and order.'"" The Trump campaign is ""driving home that message 
with a new ad that tries to tie its dark portrayal of Democratic-led cities"" to Joe Biden ""with 
exaggerated images intended to persuade viewers that lawless anarchy would prevail if Mr. Biden 
won the presidency."" To date, the campaign has spent ""almost $20 million over the last 20 days"" 
on the ads.

bipartisan bid to bar the Pentagon from transferring a wide range of military-grade weaponry to 
local police departments, effectively killing the last remaining initiative before Congress this year 
to address the excessive use of force in law enforcement."" The measure, which lawmakers ""sought

enforcement after a nationwide uproar to address racial discrimination and distrust between the

the required 60-vote threshold to pass, underscored how fraught and often fruitless attempts to

read that Purnell's cousin was shot by ""a uniformed security guard.""

this point."" Travers ""said he's never seen such bad relations between intelligence professionals and

Gents, 
Do you have any information regarding the inquiry below? The media is reporting ""anonymous FBI agent at the American 
embassy in Stockholm"" claims the FBI is interested in the Crown Princess and another Norwegian citizen. Certainly if 
anyone in Norway has pertinent information regarding the case we would be interested, however, we are unaware of any 
current interest in Norway. Let me know if anything comes up.

Subject: Question about Jeffrey Epstein and 
To whom it may concern, 
I'm contacting you on behalf of VG, Norway's biggest newspaper, to enquire about a quote which is attributed to 
an anonymous FBI agent at the American embassy in Stockholm. According to the Norwegian newspaper 
Dagbladet/Se og Her, the FBI agent says: ""FBI wants to speak with . We're still trying to trace 
information about Epstein"". 
According to flight logs travelled with Jeffalpaein's private jet several times, and we're 
wondering if it is correct that the FBI wants to speak with in connection to Epstein? If so: Why? What 
information are you hoping to discover? Have you already contacted Are there any other Norwegian 
citizens or residents you wish to contact? Has there been any contact between the FBI or other American 
agencies and the Norwe ian overnment, Norwegian Police Security Service or other agencies concerning 
Jeffrey Epstein, or Crown Princess Mette-Marit? 
If you could please get back to me at your earliest convenience, I would greatly appreciate it.

No. 
Eyes started on January 7 or so (I was planning to fly from SF to West Palm Beach to meet Mette and you!) 
After so many procedures — and in the midst of it (I did not know if I will see or not due to cataracts), Bill hit me in mid 
June. 
This made a trauma so much bigger

PS: ci-dessous notre dernière échange concernant les Marathoniennes de Philippe HIQUILY. 
De : Lelouch 
Date : samedi 18 mars 2017 13:41 
: Stephane Zalejski 
Objet : Marathonienne bM 
Cher Stéphane, 
J'ai essayé de vous joindre hier. 
Je vous confirme le prix de 135 000 € pour une Marathonienne de 6,20 mètre, je vous indique qu'il faudra un acompte à la 
commande pour déclencher la fabrication 
Et compte tenu de la taille de l'objet, il faudra s'organiser pour que l'enlèvement se fasse rapidement une fois la sculpture 
terminée. 
Le délai de fabrication sera d'environ 8 à 10 semaines. 
J'attends votre retour, 
Quand à la Marathonienne de 210 cm de hauteur, je la récupère courant de la semaine prochaine. 
Voulez-vous que je vous la mette en réserve pour votre client? 
Je devrais être à Paris lundi dans l'après midi mais reste joignable sur mon portable quand vous voulez. 
Bien à vous 
Jean-Marc Lelouch

You sink into the sofa. cocktail in hand. It was a long day, you think to yourself. and you kick off your 
shoes, sending them across the room with a thump. The shades are drawn, casting a shadowy glow 
over the room. It's dotted with bold, dark furniture, broken up by the occasional dramatic print or pillow. 
Suddenly, the phone rings. Your heart begins to race. Who could be calling at this hour? SHOP NOW

While they are in Norway, Bill and Melinda might enjoy meeting Terje and his wife, ( also a diplomat, she was 
nominated to be Ambassador to the US ) , and/or Thjorbom Jagland and his wife, both have houses on the 
fjords, I can arrange it if Bill wants. I assume they will meet Mette and Halken anyway. 
I will be able to speak with Larry late in the day tomorrow. This week I am swamped . I see now, that even late 
friday won't work. for Bill. I can confirm the 8th or 9th ( dinner ? ) I might be able to travel to Norway , if he 
would enjoy that , but I obviously need to better understand the reason for the deadline. Is there some sort of 
public filing requirement for the foundation? Would a signed but undated letter of resignation satisfy Meilinda's 
requirements. ?"

Jeffrey 
It has taken me some time to respond 
Because I was in some way so overwhelmed by emotion from your email 
I know it is silly to smoke 
It pulls me not only physically towards darkness 
Isn't it so telling that that I started smoking again exactly when I met him 
I appreciate the tenderness in your email 
So I followed up. The smoking course is booked for the week I get back 
I havent gotten the trainer in place yet but will do research in Miami so I will be ready to start when I get back 
I don't know if I told you but the doctor warned me about the smoking when he examined my lungs 
At first they thought it was a blot clot.. Only dark shadows from Small things I don't know the names of 
screaming for fresh air 
Jeffrey he made me feel like the most beautiful woman on earth 
I know I will have to find that somewhere else 
And I know the only answer is within 
Thank you for seeing me 
Mm"

They are likely to decline - and honestly after my interview with the woman who would 
be my boss I am not sure it would be wise to take the job. During the interview she told 
me she really wanted an internal candidate and that bringing in an outsider meant a 
huge waste of time for her...""uhhh "" 
Anyway I have a really cool plan/idea. I think you will support it and reeally like it. Still

involves the WB. Got another note from Bill who really wants me to be at the WB. Too 
much to type...want to talk soon? 
Also - a really really neat idea from Steve and the LA boys. VERY CLEVER, it surprised 
me. The analogous Hollywood version of Intellectual Ventures (Nathan's gig). 
How is Mette feeling? Does she really have dengue? 
Want to talk soon? Tomorrow night late we get to BKK. There till Thursday.

tons, and they all lead to the same conclusion, that nature protects even its vegtables. . the most potent poisons 
are NATURAL, the most diseases are a result of other species winnng out, the idea that living in sync with 
nature is not from 1998 but from 1998 BC . a concept that championed four humors. earth water fire etc. , 
anti -biotics , are exactly that, things that kill natural organisms, . i hope you are smiling, i know you prefer

Ive read and i will not send you dollar bill 
The article states that the research has not found evidence that organic food contain higher rates of vitamins and 
nutrients other than potassium 
It however argues there is higher risk for finding higher levels of pesticides in non org food although it is 
believed that these levels are not high enough to pose significant health risks 
If I remember correctly you stated that organic food was in fact more unhealthy based on this article which I can 
see no proof of 
Hence the dollar bill is mine

Just talked to Kimbal. His actual bday is on Thursday night (although his party is 
on Saturday). 
Kimbal, Elon and few of their closest friends will go out that night. 
I told him that I am going w Mette for that Gala and that after we wil join them 
somewhere — or even easiest that they should come to Boom Boom Room. 
I told him that you will join us as well. Also I told him that you are coming with 
Jennifer and that he might want to ditch his ex/or current to be. He said yes and is 
looking so much forward. 
So please prepare Jen —;) 
She might like Elon as well.

I think that even if she has a small lump it is a benign. She does need surgery. 
Strangely it turns out that she told so many people re her surgery on 21. From mette to people at work. 
All are very sympathetic.

Eva is my friend there who will host us. She is very close friend with Mette as well. 
Eva and I are still trying to get Mette to join at the last moment. 
She and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below. 
The plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day. 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito and we go to that. 
ON Friday Eva is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other meetings/visits 
during day. 
On Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning. 
I leave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill. 
If you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like Eva) you should go to her brunch. 
How this seems to you???

Hallo everybody! 
Attached (sorry in Germain) the Programm fort he lifeball on the 19th. 
Actually there will be a Galadinner with our prime minister and Bill Clinton and all kinds of stars in the Hofburg 
(former Imerial estate - very impressive to see from inside)) It is only 250 people,. A seated dinner and more 
upscale than the rest oft he evening. It start's at 5pm with a Champagne cocktail and from there we go directly to 
the opening oft he ball where we'll have a really cool Box first row!! 
Dresscode: actually the lifeball is really crazy and 'half naked' We always do a intermediare because otherwise 
you feel like an idiot at the Amfar Gala dinner before. People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. Christoph 
wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be in any crazy stuff 
on all the pies. Half oft he people oft he gala dinenr also waer some 'little' crazy stuff like pink velvet sakkos 
(and a mask for later) or so. girls: Crazy as you like. There are a lot of atrists that are really dressed up. I will 
wear a quiet see-through short dress with high high heels+ a chanel Tatoo and will take a face mask fort he ball 
later. 
EFTA00934398 
So I hope this helped at least a little bit. For pies got to: lifeball.org 
Friday night: We would like to invite you all for dinner and will organize a nice place with a cool bar. Aress 
follows. Pls let me know who wants to join!! 
Sunday: I'm very sure we'll be dead :- BUT we would like to invite ou to our house/garden/pool (swimmwear) 
for brunch starting at 11 15 min with Taxi. If you fly late 
we can walk from our house to one oft he famous Austrian heurigen ...and get some more alcholic to drink :-) :-) 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito. Very hard to get tickets but for 2 of you I 
could still organize (hopefully9 if some of you already arrive on Thursday. 
Big kiss to everbody...I promise you...not often you will have seen something that crazy :-)

rest think you are working against your inetersts.. here bill has someone who works 20 hrs a 
day„ is willing to take on more, and doens't require more pay. you are traingin him to take you 
for granted and expecting him to appreciate you after the fact. . wishful thinking. I think your 
proposal should be as a fair split, he should get the 20% of the net. and allocate 30-40 million 
from larsen. . otherwise you can point out that even if you were to get a 100% return on the 10 
million, over 4 years.. an unlikely result, you would end up with less than 1.5 ,million after tax 
after 4 years,,, not fair

I already discussed that. 
Mette will meet us in Paris before Vienna. 
She does not like spending time in Oslo right now. 
She is in Paris right now. 
She is still thinking of going to Vienna — although it is not likely unless we push her. 
The following Sunday she is coming to visit me in Seattle. And she wants to go home to see kids before Seattle 
She will be also in NYC for a Met Ball Gala.

You should get a villa and do it next year 
Experience like no other, plenty of good and bad but quite collection of people 
My highlights (in no particular order) 
Hosting the global shapers from around the world (under 30) 
interactions with David Rubenstein 
Dinner with bill 
Chilling with mette and haakon 
Watching Boris be Boris 
I learned that I can bring a ""spouse"" with all access no questions asked. So it I get invited next year 
please be my ""spouse"". Not sure I will get invited back but maybe. 
Basically I learned that none of these ""elite"" know much more individually than I do, but their networks 
are force multipliers 
I enjoyed the philosophical discussions on capitalism 
My panel went very well (urban development in 21st century) but other private sector panelists seemed 
underinformed about Africa. It was head of Africa development bank, a big real estate guy, Cisco guy, 
transport guy and me. Questions from audience felt very superficial. 
Met some Russian oligarchs, one who told me ""you are too beautiful to fly commercial"" when I said I 
was leaving tomorrow 
Christine lagarde is super insecure, which was unexpected 
Arianna huffintlgton is mean to her staff 
Nuriel roubini had a huge bunch of ""girlfriend"" types which was weird be he's gross 
Mick jagger was tons of fun (he's 72) and surprisingly smart 
Only about 10% of attendees are ""real"" females the rest of the ladies are staff 
Oh met some woman from jp Morgan I think her name was Mary. She called you UNCLE F which made 
me think she was a friend but Boris later told me she was not a friend. 
I also wrote an ft story about dressing challenges 
EFTA_R1_00481194 
EFTA01989089 
Overall a terrific learning experience. Boris is my hero. He was probably the most sought after man at 
the entire event and handled it with style. 
Bill was the smartest guy on all the panels but I am not sure he was well received by the leaders. 
Certainly an ego boost for bill.

Too many. It is a zoo here. 
Super busy. 
Last night a small dinner with few good friends — Bill, David Rubenstein, Mette, Hakkon, Vivek (ex — Chief Information 
officer of USA), Consuelo, Andy, and Melanie. 
Fun! Whish that you were there. 
After that with Mette, Hakkon and Melanie we hit a town — until very late. I actually like Hakkon a LOT! Met Mike Jager. 
Melanie is doing great job at her first davos. 
I just wish that you were her. We would have so much fun!!! 
More to come need to run for a next meeting 
How you are doingm?? 
Miss you!

You are greatly missed here. 
Was calling you with Mette the other day. 
It is fun — BUT it is super intense — every day from 7am to 2am non-stop. 
Tonight I organized a very small dinner with Bill, david Rubenstein, Mette, Hakoon, Consuela, few other interesting YGL 
and Melanie. 
After that some hottest after party in Davos — going as Mette's date. 
On Saturday gong to London — and then all starts again.

No problem. 
I am not that concerned YET. 
It was my mistake (sort of — as it needed to happened sooner than later) to do it at the time I am not sure that there is 
enough time — I knew that he is traveling and not reachable for Thanksgiving. Also that Monday is totally full. I am getting 
the first time possible. 
Let's hold judgment until the meeting.
